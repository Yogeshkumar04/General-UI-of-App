# General-UI-of-App
Internshala Trainings (Android App Development) Assignment (Android Kick-off)

This Project I have used:
 * Different types of layouts (Linear, Relative or ScrollView)
 * Various Widgets (TextView, EditText, ImageView, Buttons,etc)
 * Intents and Shared Preferences

Woking :

* A welcome/start page that displays the app logo and disapears after a few seconds.
  This is known as the Splash Page. This page contains only a background and an Image
  placed in the center of the page.
  
* The next is the Login Page which contains the two Edit Texts and a Button to log in.
  Along with these you also find some text which generally says 'if you do not have an
  account, Register' and 'Forgot Password'.
 
* When you click on the registration text, you are sent to a new page which requires you
  to fill some details like name, phone numbers, email address, password and then you can
  register with the application. This page is the Registration Page of the application.
 
* Similarly, clicking on the forgor password text sends you to some other page having
  different functionalities.
